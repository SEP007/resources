#Second requirements proposal meeting

##Summary

* The requirements proposal document is finished (check google docs). It was complemented with system introduction and new requirements. If you have any suggestions for improvements, you have time until tomorrow (September 27th).
* We went through [the list of possible additions or changes] (https://github.com/SEP007/resources/blob/master/system-proposals.md#lmvc-patat-on-github) again. Some of the features were not included in the requirements proposal, we will see how it goes and discuss them further in the project.

###Reminder for the meeting with Ana on September 27th.
* Ask about the next assignment (Quality attributes proposal)
* Ask about testing (an open issue from the last lecture)

##Agenda
* Next meeting is happening tomorrow (September 27th) after the meeting with Ana.
* No scheduled meeting on Monday (September 30th) as most of the group have a lecture.
* Scheduled meeting on Thursday (October 3rd) as usual (13.00).
* We will work on the next assignment. No details since we don't know the assignment yet.

##General reminder
* Not showing up to group meetings with no notice in advance is [fined] (https://github.com/SEP007/resources/blob/master/member-fines.md#fines-for-members-for-not-being-cool).
