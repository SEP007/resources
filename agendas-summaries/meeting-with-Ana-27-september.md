#Meeting with Ana 27th of September

##Next assignment
* Look at the quality model (one of the papers)
* See which attributes apply to our project
* Produce the model for our project
* If we remove any attributes - explain why
 
###Individual part
* Everyone has to choose 1-2 attributes to measure during the project (effort load should be equal for everyone hence 1-2)
 * No two people should have the same measurements (duh)
* For every chosen attribute we should explain: what will you measure, how will you measure it and how often (e.g. once in every 2 weeks)
* If suggested way of measurements seems unreasonable for the projcect - we can show another way and explain it. 

##Handin for the next assignment should include
* qulity model
* arguement for the model (especially if something was removed)
* chosen attributes, their explanations and people responsible


##General updates
* Ana will upload a template for a final group report
