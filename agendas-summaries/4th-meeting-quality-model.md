OBS!!!

## Process

- We are going to use Hub board.
- Two people are going to review the code of everybody and if they want to comment on it they are free to do it.
- Don't mess up with other people's code!
- If you don't have code coverage above 60% we need to discuss if it is mergeable.
- Stand up meetings every time we are meeting in the beggining of the day.

## Coordination

- Iva focusses on the weekends and it's ok from all of us to be one sprint behind :)
- Khan is it an option for you as well to work like that? Please come back on that as we wish to discuss more things
with you :)
