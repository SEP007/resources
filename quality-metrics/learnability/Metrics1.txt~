Learnability:

Use case #14:
All of the users understood how to add dishes in specific categories within the limit of 30 seconds. No failures
have been noticed. I observed that it was slightly hard for them to find where exactly the add button was but all of them
found it within the time limit.

Use case #6:
All of the users were able to find, during the given timeframe of 30 seconds, whether they want directions to a restaurant by foot
or by vehicle. There was one incident though that the user accidentally discovered this functionality. The feedback that the
user gave was that it would be easier if we would have next to the small map the buttons "walking" and "driving". The user
claimed that he just wanted to enlarge the map and that had as a result to actually click on it and then see the options
"walking" and "driving".

Use case #7:
All of the users logged in succesfully in the system during the given timeframe of 30 seconds.
