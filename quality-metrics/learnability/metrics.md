Learnability:

A newly proposed metric is going to be used for measuring the learnability of Patat. After discussion within the group it has been decided that the following metric is easier to be applied. From random users is going to be asked to use Patat in order to give feedback if they understand the new functionalities correctly. They will be measured in how much time they managed to do a required action in the system. There will be a time limit of 30 seconds. If they succeed in this time it will be count as a positive feedback, if they will fail or they need more information or time about how to do the task that was asked from us it will count as a negative feedback. The results will immediately be shared within the team in order to be discussed. The questions to the users will be made in the end of every sprint because then is the most probable case of have a new functionality done. It is important to measure the time that users need to fulfill the task that was asked from us to do because it directly indicates the learnability of Patat.

Use case #14:
All of the users understood how to add dishes in specific categories within the limit of 30 seconds. No failures
have been noticed. I observed that it was slightly hard for them to find where exactly the add button was but all of them
found it within the time limit.

Use case #6:
All of the users were able to find, during the given timeframe of 30 seconds, whether they want directions to a restaurant by foot
or by vehicle. There was one incident though that the user accidentally discovered this functionality. The feedback that the
user gave was that it would be easier if we would have next to the small map the buttons "walking" and "driving". The user
claimed that he just wanted to enlarge the map and that had as a result to actually click on it and then see the options
"walking" and "driving".

Use case #7:
All of the users logged in succesfully in the system during the given timeframe of 30 seconds.
