Changeability

The Change recordability metric will be used to measure changeability of Patat. What is going to be measured is 
if changes in specification are recorded adequately in the code. A document will automatically be generated with only 
the new methods that the team has developed with respective documentation about these methods. By counting the number 
of the documented ones divided by the total number of the new methods will indicate how methods can be easily changed 
or not. If the number is closer to 1 then the changes can be made in a easier way because they are documented. 
If the number is closer to 0, that indicates that Patat has poor change control because there is no documentation 
and that makes it the change on a method almost impossible. The changeability is going to be measured after a sprint 
because it would be a good idea for the team to see in a small period of times if the team is documenting the methods 
that is writing and within that short period of time the members that wrote a method without documentation could easily 
remember what they wrote and they can document their method. Measuring the changeability in a given system can help the 
developers to save time by easily understanding the methods that would possibly like to change.
