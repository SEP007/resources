# PHP Gotchas

## Automatic Typecasting

...meaning: punch a primitive type until it suits your needs.
@kostas was asking about this example from the *CodeAcademy* where a simple addition is performed in the way of:

```php
echo "40 + 2 = " +1
```

which gives `41`. One might cry but that's how casting internally works as `(int) "40 + 2 = "` gives `40`.

Back to the first example: the PHP runtime will discover an operation of type addition. The right hand assignment is a `1`, the operator a `+` and the left hand is a string `"40 + 2 = "` which makes PHP gulp for a second - what's its gonna do now? Operations can only be performed on numbers so the left hand side needs to become a number too and by casting it, it becomes `40` cause the *string itself will not be evaluated as an expression!*

## Strings and Variable Interpolation

...is: how to concatinate string with variables and not get surprised.
At some point strings and variables need to be concatinted to get some dynamic output. Consider the following example:

```php
$a = "Adonis!";
echo "Kostas is an $a";
```

This will output `Kostas is an Adonis!` cause the runtime will look into the string and find the variable flying around in there which then will be replaced with its content in `Adonis!`. This after all, makes PHP a decent templating language already. Anyhow, whenever you type something like:

```php
$a = "Adonis!";
echo 'Kostas is an $a';
```

*Note the single quotes!* You are basically promising PHP a string without varibles, telling it not having to look into it and doing the interpolation - which is of course minimally faster. If you wanted to concatinate a string the hard way, you could do:

```php
$a = "Adonis!";
echo 'Kostas is an ' . $a;

# or

echo "Kostas is an " . $a;

```

...in any case `Adonis!` does not be in double quotes as it is never meant to carry a variable.

One thing: when using arrays in a string automatic string concatinating makes code some what unreadble. Take a look:

```php
# Looks okay
$a = ["Adonis!", "man!"];

echo "Kostas is an $a[0]"; # outputs ...Adonis!

# Lets use an associative array
$a = [
   "key1" => "Adonis!",
   "key2" => "man!"
];

echo "Kostas is an $a[key1]"; # outputs ...Adonis!
echo "Kostas is an $a['key1']"; # is a parse error!

echo 'Kostas is an '. $a['key1']; # outputs ...Adonis!
```

â€¦to me the last option looks best as its easy to see what's going on but that's up to decide to everybody or the team's coding standards.
