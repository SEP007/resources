##Sprint Retrospective 22/11

#Positive
* Retrospective worked well
* Scrum master is getting better
* Poster Session worked. Nice idea!
* Stand ups went better
* Communication in the team was better
* Planning was better


#Negative
* Communication should be improved
* The team is lacking motivation for working in the projects
* Tobi wants his life back


#Things that need to change for the next sprint
* Planning took too much time
* Smaller and sooner pushes to github, in order to better review the code
* We should fix the structure of user stories.
  * they do not start with the phrase "As a ...."
  * the labelling to the user stories is confusing
